Email from Tim Savas re: how we treated the clipped branches


My query:
Finally, I do have one query — when we chilled the clippings in Dan’s 
January 2015 experiment (the first one) did we clip them and put them in 
flasks and change the water (aka, do everything we did to the clippings 
going into warmer conditions) when they were being ‘chilled’ or did they 
stay in black bags? Or get treated in any way differently? 

Tim’s reply:
We treated them the same––they were put into flasks as they entered the refrigerators/freezers and stayed in flasks throughout the chilling period––no bags. Water was changed roughly every two weeks––water tended to stay much cleaner in the flasks during the chilling periods (makes sense, lower temps, less light etc.)
