@article{Kjell-Bolmgren:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Herbarium phenology data were evaluated and then applied in a phylogenetically independent contrast study in which flowering times were compared between fleshy and nonfleshy‐fruited plants growing in the north‐temperate provinces of Uppland and S{\"o}dermanland, southeastern Sweden (59$\,^{\circ}$--60$\,^{\circ}$N). To evaluate herbarium phenology data, flowering‐time information taken from herbarium specimens in the Swedish Natural History Museum (S) was compared with two independent field phenology data sets. Herbarium collections and the field studies were restricted to the province of Uppland. Flowering times derived from herbarium specimens correlated equally well with each of the two field‐phenology data sets as the field phenology data sets did to each other. Differences between flowering times derived from field and herbarium collections were not affected by the number of herbarium specimens used. However, these differences in flowering times were affected by flowering season such that herbarium‐derived flowering times were later for early spring‐flowering species and earlier for late summer‐flowering species when compared with flowering times derived from field data. In the phylogenetically independent contrast study of mean flowering times in fleshy‐ compared with nonfleshy‐fruited plants, herbarium data were compiled for 77 species in 17 phylogenetically independent contrasts. Flowering time was found to be earlier for fleshy‐fruited taxa, illustrating the evolutionary interdependence between flowering and fruiting phases and the constraining effects of a north‐temperate climate on phenology evolution. This study shows that herbaria are reliable and time‐saving data sources for comparative phenology studies and allow for studies at large phylogenetic and geographic scales that would otherwise be impossible.},

@article{CaraDonna:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Phenology--the timing of biological events--is highly sensitive to climate change. However, our general understanding of how phenology responds to climate change is based almost solely on incomplete assessments of phenology (such as first date of flowering) rather than on entire phenological distributions. Using a uniquely comprehensive 39-y flowering phenology dataset from the Colorado Rocky Mountains that contains more than 2 million flower counts, we reveal a diversity of species-level phenological shifts that bring into question the accuracy of previous estimates of long-term phenological change. For 60 species, we show that first, peak, and last flowering rarely shift uniformly and instead usually shift independently of one another, resulting in a diversity of phenological changes through time. Shifts in the timing of first flowering on average overestimate the magnitude of shifts in the timing of peak flowering, fail to predict shifts in the timing of last flowering, and underrepresent the number of species changing phenology in this plant community. Ultimately, this diversity of species-level phenological shifts contributes to altered coflowering patterns within the community, a redistribution of floral abundance across the season, and an expansion of the flowering season by more than I mo during the course of our study period. These results demonstrate the substantial reshaping of ecological communities that can be attributed to shifts in phenology.},

@article{Ellwood:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The strength and direction of phenological responses to changes in climate have been shown to vary significantly both among species and among populations of a species, with the overall patterns not fully resolved. Here, we studied the temporal and spatial variability associated with the response of several insect species to recent global warming. We use hierarchical models within a model comparison framework to analyze phenological data gathered over 40 years by the Japan Meteorological Agency on the emergence dates of 14 insect species at sites across Japan. Contrary to what has been predicted with global warming, temporal trends of annual emergence showed a later emergence day for some species and sites over time, even though temperatures are warming. However, when emergence data were analyzed as a function of temperature and precipitation, the overall response pointed out an earlier emergence day with warmer conditions. The apparent contradiction between the response to temperature and trends over time indicates that other factors, such as declining populations, may be affecting the date phenological events are being recorded. Overall, the responses by insects were weaker than those found for plants in previous work over the same time period in these ecosystems, suggesting the potential for ecological mismatches with deleterious effects for both suites of species. And although temperature may be the major driver of species phenology, we should be cautious when analyzing phenological datasets as many other factors may also be contributing to the variability in phenology.},

	Abstract = {Questions(1) Do woody species flourish and fructify according to environmental seasonality? (2) Is there a positive correlation with dry/rainy season? (3) Are the flowering and fruiting of woody species positively correlated with rainfall, temperature and photoperiod? (4) Do anemochorous, autochorous and zoochorous species fructify according to environmental seasonality, i.e. dry or rainy season? LocationThorn forest, southern Midwest Brazil. MethodsQualitative data collection included the presence or absence of flowers and/or fruits of each species, independently of the development phase of their reproductive organs. A Rayleigh test was used to determine if flowering and fructification were seasonal throughout the year and to detect possible significant seasonal patterns. Spearman's rank correlation and Bonferroni correction were used to determine possible correlations between phenological events and rainfall, temperature and photoperiod. ResultsFlowering and fruiting of the woody community showed a low degree of seasonality. No significant correlations were found between flowering and fructification and the climatic variables studied: temperature, photoperiod and rainfall. Approximately 60% of the zoochorous species bore fruit during the rainy season, but with a low degree of seasonality. The fruiting of anemochorous species presented two opposite points of higher frequency, corresponding to the transition period between rainfall and drought and the rainy season. No seasonality was found. Autochorous species showed no pattern of seasonal fruiting. ConclusionsThe data on flowering and fruiting in the community studied are unexpected and contrast with studies performed in seasonal environments. Seed dispersal syndromes showed no significant seasonal events. These results differ from those usually found in markedly seasonal environments. The Brazilian Chaco can be considered an arid environment in which abiotic syndromes prevail in a manner similar to that seen in tropical dry forests.},

	Abstract = {Blackcurrant is a short day plant that ceases growing and initiates flowers at photoperiods shorter than a critical length. Surprisingly, however, the flowering response was found to be several-fold stronger in the near-critical photoperiod of 15 h than in shorter photoperiods down to 10 h (Heide and Sonsteby, 2011). This unusual response of a short day plant was confirmed by the present experiments where plants were exposed to 15 and 10 h photoperiods for 5 weeks at 18 degrees C. Also, plants exposed to naturally decreasing day-length from July, produced significantly more flowers than plants exposed to the shorter day-lengths in August. Furthermore, plants exposed to controlled photoperiods decreasing from 15 h to 10 h responded in much the same way as those in constant 15 h, while the reverse changes from 10 h to 15 h mimicked the response to constant 10 h photoperiod. Superior flower induction was always associated with a gradual reduction in growth rate followed by a delayed cessation of growth, while the sparse-flowering plants underwent an early and abrupt cessation of growth. We therefore conclude that the prompt growth cessation induced by an abrupt change to SD well below the 'critical length also interferes with flowering by arresting floral initiation at an early stage. Accordingly, the optimum photoperiod for flowering in black currant must be short enough to allow flower initiation and still long enough to prevent premature dormancy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Jochner:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Although recent global warming trends in air temperature are not as pronounced as those observed only one decade ago, global mean temperature is still at a very high level. Does plant phenology - which is believed to be a suitable indicator of climate change - respond in a similar way, that is, does it still mirror recent temperature variations? We explored in detail long-term flowering onset dates of snowdrop, cherry, and lime tree and relevant spring temperatures at three sites in Germany (1901-2012) using the Bayesian multiple change-point approach. We investigated whether mean spring temperature changes were amplified or slowed down in the past decade and how plant phenology responded to the most recent temperature changes. Incorporating records with different end points (i.e., 2002 and 2012), we compared differences in trends and inferred possible differences caused by extrapolating phenological and meteorological data. The new multiple-change point approach is characterized by an enhanced structure and greater flexibility compared to the one change point model. However, the highest model probabilities for phenological (meteorological) records were still obtained for the one change point (linear) model. Marked warming trends in the recent decade were only revealed for mean temperatures of March to May, here better described with one or two change point models. In the majority of cases analyzed, changes in temperatures were well mirrored by phenological changes. However, temperatures in March to May were linked to less strongly advancing onset dates for lime tree flowering during the period 1901-2012, pointing to the likely influence of photoperiodic constraints or unfulfilled chilling requirements. Due to the slowdown of temperature increase, analyses conducted on records ending in 2002 demonstrated distinct differences when compared with records ending in 2012. Extrapolation of trends could therefore (along with the choice of the statistical method) lead to distinctly different results and most recent data should be integrated in order not to over- or underestimate future phenological changes.},

@article{Keenan:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Autumn senescence regulates multiple aspects of ecosystem function, along with associated feedbacks to the climate system. Despite its importance, current understanding of the drivers of senescence is limited, leading to a large spread in predictions of how the timing of senescence, and thus the length of the growing season, will change under future climate conditions. The most commonly held paradigm is that temperature and photoperiod are the primary controls, which suggests a future extension of the autumnal growing season as global temperatures rise. Here, using two decades of ground- and satellite-based observations of temperate deciduous forest phenology, we show that the timing of autumn senescence is correlated with the timing of spring budburst across the entire eastern United States. On a year-to-year basis, an earlier/later spring was associated with an earlier/later autumn senescence, both for individual species and at a regional scale. We use the observed relationship to develop a novel model of autumn phenology. In contrast to current phenology models, this model predicts that the potential response of autumn phenology to future climate change is strongly limited by the impact of climate change on spring phenology. Current models of autumn phenology therefore may overpredict future increases in the length of the growing season, with subsequent impacts for modeling future CO2 uptake and evapotranspiration.},

	Abstract = {Warming experiments are increasingly relied on to estimate plant responses to global climate change. For experiments to provide meaningful predictions of future responses, they should reflect the empirical record of responses to temperature variability and recent warming, including advances in the timing of flowering and leafing. We compared phenology (the timing of recurring life history events) in observational studies and warming experiments spanning four continents and 1,634 plant species using a common measure of temperature sensitivity (change in days per degree Celsius). We show that warming experiments underpredict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing by 8.5-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively, compared with long-term observations. For species that were common to both study types, the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities, but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations, however, could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data, or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils, thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re-evaluated.},

	Abstract = {Studies of experimental grassland communities have demonstrated that plant diversity can stabilize productivity through species asynchrony, in which decreases in the biomass of some species are compensated for by increases in others. However, it remains unknown whether these findings are relevant to natural ecosystems, especially those for which species diversity is threatened by anthropogenic global change. Here we analyse diversity-stability relationships from 41 grasslands on five continents and examine how these relationships are affected by chronic fertilization, one of the strongest drivers of species loss globally. Unmanipulated communities with more species had greater species asynchrony, resulting in more stable biomass production, generalizing a result from biodiversity experiments to real-world grasslands. However, fertilization weakened the positive effect of diversity on stability. Contrary to expectations, this was not due to species loss after eutrophication but rather to an increase in the temporal variation of productivity in combination with a decrease in species asynchrony in diverse communities. Our results demonstrate separate and synergistic effects of diversity and eutrophication on stability, emphasizing the need to understand how drivers of global change interactively affect the reliable provisioning of ecosystem services in real-world systems.},

	Abstract = {Distribution of vegetation is closely coupled with climate; the climate controls distribution of vegetation and the vegetation type reflects regional climates. To reveal vegetation-climate relationships is the foundation for understanding the vegetation distribution and theoretically serving vegetation regionalization. Vegetation regionalization is a theoretical integration of vegetation studies arid provides a base for physiogeographical regionalization as well as agriculture and forestry regionalization. Based on a brief historical overview on studies of vegetation-climate relationships and vegetation regionalization conducted in China, we review the principles, bases and major schemes of previous vegetation regionalization arid discuss on several contentious boundaries of vegetation zones in the present paper. We proposed that, under the circumstances that the primary vegetation has been destroyed in most parts Of China, the division of vegetation zones/regions should be based on the distribution of primary and its secondary vegetation types and climatic indices that delimit distribution of the vegetation types. This not only reveals the closed relationship between vegetation and climate, but also is feasible practically. Although there still are divergence of views on the name and their boundaries of the several vegetation zones, it is commonly accepted that there are eight major vegetation regions in China, i.e. cold temperate needleleaf forest region, temperate needleleaf and broadleaf mixed forest region, warm temperate deciduous broadleaf forest region, subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest region, tropical monsoon forest and rain forest region, temperate steppe region, temperate desert region, and Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau high-cold vegetation region. Analyzing characteristics of vegetation and climate of major vegetation boundaries, we suggested that: 1) Qinling Mountain-Huaihe River line is an important arid/humid climatic, but not a thermal climatic boundary, and thus can not also be regarded as the northern limit of the subtropical vegetation zone; 2) the northern limit of subtropical vegetation zone in China is along the northern coast of the Yangtze River, from Hangzhou Bay, via Taihu Lake, Xuancheng and Tongling in Anhui Province, through by southern slope of the Dabie Mountains, to Wuhan and its west, coinciding with a warmth index (WI) value of 130 - 140 degreesC month; 3) the tropical region is limited in a very small area in southeastern Hainan Island and southern edge of Taiwan Island; and 4) considering a significant difference in climates between the southern and northern parts of the warm temperate zone, we suggested that the warm temperate zone in China is divided into two vegetation regions, deciduous broadleaf woodland region and deciduous and evergreen broadleaf mixed forest region, the Qinling Mountain-Huaihe River line being as their boundary. We also claimed that the zonal vegetation in North China is deciduous broadleaf woodland. Finally, we emphasized the importance of dynamic vegetation regionalization linked to climate changes.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the independent and combined effects of experimental warming and grazing on plant species diversity on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau, a region highly vulnerable to ongoing climate and land use changes. Experimental warming caused a 26-36% decrease in species richness, a response that was generally dampened by experimental grazing. Higher species losses occurred at the drier sites where N was less available. Moreover, we observed an indirect effect of climate change on species richness as mediated by plant-plant interactions. Heat stress and warming-induced litter accumulation are potential explanations for the species' responses to experimental warming. This is the first reported experimental evidence that climate warming could cause dramatic declines in plant species diversity in high elevation ecosystems over short time frames and supports model predictions of species losses with anthropogenic climate change.},

	Abstract = {Leaf N and P stoichiometry covaries with many aspects of plant biology, yet the drivers of this trait at biogeographic scales remain uncertain. Recently we reported the patterns of leaf C and N based on systematic census of 213 species over 199 research sites in the grassland biomes of China. With the expanded analysis of leaf P, here we report patterns of leaf P and N:P ratios, and analyze the relative contribution of climatic variables and phylogeny in structuring patterns of leaf N:P stoichiometry. Average values of leaf P and N:P ratio were 1.9 mg g(-1) and 15.3 (mass ratio), respectively, consistent with the previous observation of a higher N:P ratio in China's flora than the global averages (ca. 13.8), resulting from a lower leaf P. Climatic variables had very little direct correlation with leaf P and N:P ratios, with growing season precipitation and temperature together explaining less than 2% of the variation, while inter-site differences and within-site phylogenetic variation explained 55 and 26% of the total variation in leaf P and N:P ratios. Across all sites and species, leaf N and P were highly positively correlated at all levels. However, the within-site, within-species covariations of leaf N and P were weaker than those across sites and across species. Leaf N and P relationships are driven by both variation between sites at the landscape scale (explaining 58% of the variance) and within sites at the local scale (explaining 24%), while the climatic factors exerted limited influence (explaining less than 3%). In addition, leaf N:P ratios in two dominant genera Kobresia and Stipa had different responses to precipitation. This study suggests that geographic variation and between-species variation, rather than climatic variation, are the major determinants of grassland foliar stoichiometry at the biome level.},

In the present study, the changes of plant species diversity and aboveground biomass productivity were examined along with the altitude in natural alpine grassland in the source region of three rivers on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Eleven experimental locations were selected with altitudes ranging from 3862 to 4450 m above sea level (a.s.l.). The results indicated that Kobresia pygmaea meadow, Kobresia humilis meadow and Salix cupularis shrub meadow had higher indices of diversity and aboveground biomass. The distribution of species diversity, richness and aboveground biomass showed similarly unimodal patterns across the altitude gradient with the highest indices appeared at mid-altitudes locations. The changing trend of species diversity, richness and evenness also showed significant unimodal patterns with total aboveground biomass, and the highest species diversity occurred at intermediate level of productivities. This research would provide a valuable reference for the protection of grassland biodiversity and maintaining of the grazing ecosystem function in the source region of the Three Rivers.},

	Abstract = {We investigated experimental warming and simulated grazing ( clipping) effects on rangeland quality, as indicated by vegetation production and nutritive quality, in winter-grazed meadows and summer- grazed shrublands on the Tibetan Plateau, a rangeland system experiencing climatic and pastoral land use changes. Warming decreased total aboveground net primary productivity ( ANPP) by 40 g . m(-2) . yr(-1) at the meadow habitats and decreased palatable ANPP ( total ANPP minus non- palatable forb ANPP) by 10 g . m(-2) . yr(-1) at both habitats. The decreased production of the medicinal forb Gentiana straminea and the increased production of the non- palatable forb Stellera chamaejasme with warming also reduced rangeland quality. At the shrubland habitats, warming resulted in less digestible shrubs, whose foliage contains 25% digestible dry matter ( DDM), replacing more digestible graminoids, whose foliage contains 60% DDM. This shift from graminoids to shrubs not only results in lower- quality forage, but could also have important consequences for future domestic herd composition. Although warming extended the growing season in non- clipped plots, the reduced rangeland quality due to decreased vegetative production and nutritive quality will likely overwhelm the improved rangeland quality associated with an extended growing season. Grazing maintained or improved rangeland quality by increasing total ANPP by 20 - 40 g . m(-2) . yr(-1) with no effect on palatable ANPP. Grazing effects on forage nutritive quality, as measured by foliar nitrogen and carbon content and by shifts in plant group ANPP, resulted in improved forage quality. Grazing extended the growing season at both habitats, and it advanced the growing season at the meadows. Synergistic interactions between warming and grazing were present, such that grazing mediated the warming- induced declines in vegetation production and nutritive quality. Moreover, combined treatment effects were nonadditive, suggesting that we cannot predict the combined effect of global changes and human activities from single- factor studies. Our findings suggest that the rangelands on the Tibetan Plateau, and the pastoralists who depend on them, may be vulnerable to future climate changes. Grazing can mitigate the negative warming effects on rangeland quality. For example, grazing management may be an important tool to keep warming- induced shrub expansion in check. Moreover, flexible and opportunistic grazing management will be required in a warmer future.},

	Abstract = {Aim Our aim was to address the potential effect of the geographical range size of species on the relationships between plant traits, soil and climate in Chinese grasslands. Previous analyses tended to examine plantenvironment relationships across many species while ignoring that species with different range sizes may respond differently to the environment. Here we hypothesized that leaf traits of narrow-ranging species would be more strongly correlated with soil and climatic variables than those of wide-ranging species. Location Chinese grasslands. Methods Data on leaf traits, including nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, carbon/nitrogen ratio, nitrogen/phosphorus ratio and specific leaf area, as well as species range sizes for 208 species distributed across 178 sites in Chinese grasslands were collected. Soil and climate information for each study site was also gathered. The effects of range size on leaf traits were tested using one-way ANOVA. Correlations between leaf traits, soil and climate were calculated for all species pooled together and for species partitioned into range size quartiles, from the first (narrowest-ranging 25%) to the fourth (widest-ranging 25%). Results Narrow-ranging species tended to occur at high altitude with lower temperature but higher soil nutrient concentrations compared with wide-ranging species. No direct link between leaf traits and species range sizes was detected. However, patterns of leaf-soil nutrient relationships changed significantly across levels of range size. Narrow-ranging species tended to be more sensitive to variation in soil nutrient availability than wide-ranging species, resulting in a shift from a positive leaf-soil nutrient relationship for narrow-ranging plants to no relationship for wide-ranging plants. Species responses to climatic variables were unrelated to their range sizes. Main conclusions The close relationship between leaf and soil nutrients indicates a specialization of narrow-ranging species to particular habitats whereas wide-ranging species may be able to better withstand changes in environment such as soil fertility over a large area.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the sensitivity of tundra vegetation to climate warming is critical to forecasting future biodiversity and vegetation feedbacks to climate. In situ warming experiments accelerate climate change on a small scale to forecast responses of local plant communities. Limitations of this approach include the apparent site-specificity of results and uncertainty about the power of short-term studies to anticipate longer term change. We address these issues with a synthesis of 61 experimental warming studies, of up to 20 years duration, in tundra sites worldwide. The response of plant groups to warming often differed with ambient summer temperature, soil moisture and experimental duration. Shrubs increased with warming only where ambient temperature was high, whereas graminoids increased primarily in the coldest study sites. Linear increases in effect size over time were frequently observed. There was little indication of saturating or accelerating effects, as would be predicted if negative or positive vegetation feedbacks were common. These results indicate that tundra vegetation exhibits strong regional variation in response to warming, and that in vulnerable regions, cumulative effects of long-term warming on tundra vegetation and associated ecosystem consequences have the potential to be much greater than we have observed to date.},

	Abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau, the low-latitude and high-altitude cold region, has a variety of soils rich in organic carbon (C). Climate change will have large impacts on soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux in the region. These impacts will subsequently affect global-scale climate and C cycle links. However, the magnitude of this feedback is still uncertain. Here we use a laboratory incubation experiment to investigate how soil temperature and moisture affected the rate and temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration of three alpine ecosystems (alpine meadow [M], alpine shrubland [SB], alpine swamp [SP]) on the Tibetan Plateau. Soil samples were incubated under three temperature (0 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 30 degrees C) and two moisture (50% and 100% water-holding capacity) conditions. The response of soil respiration to temperature and moisture varied with ecosystems. Soil respiration in SP was the most temperature sensitive, and higher moisture increased its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)). The respiration and Q(10) depended on total nitrogen in soils. Moreover, high moisture increased the dependence of Q(10) on total nitrogen. Our results suggest that rising temperature in Tibetan Plateau may cause a positive feedback to the soil C cycle, particularly coupled with increasing precipitation and N addition.},

	Abstract = {Productivity of artificial grassland communities was investigated in a 6-year field experiment on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In the experiment, assemblages varying in seven species compositions and four density gradients were grown in fertilized and non-fertilized subplots. We measured biomass of sown species as an indicator of community productivity. In general, 6-years of experiments indicated that: (i) species composition had a significant influence on community productivity. During the initial phase of the experiment, sown density significantly affected community productivity, but the effects disappear with the increase of grown years. This productivity increased with biodiversity increase and fertilization, while the biodiversity effects disappeared when the influence of composition was removed. (ii) The increase of community productivity with biodiversity was resulted from joint effects of selection and complementarity. (iii) With an increase of growth time, the selection effects become weaker while complementarities become enhanced. Influence of density on both effects was significantly different in early stages, but ultimately this all became insignificant. Fertilization dramatically increased the complementarity effects in all experiment processes, but had different influences on selection effects during different experimental period.},

	Abstract = {Although broad-scale inter-specific patterns of leaf traits are influenced by climate, soil, and taxonomic identity, integrated assessments of these drivers remain rare. Here, we quantify these drivers in a field study of 171 plant species in 174 sites across Chinese grasslands, including the Tibetan Plateau, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. General linear models were used to partition leaf trait variation. Of the total variation in leaf traits, on average 27% is due to taxonomic or phylogenetic differences among species within sites (pure species effect), 29% to variation among sites within species (pure site effect), 38% to joint effects of taxonomic and environmental factors (shared effect), and 6.2% to within-site and within-species variation. Examining the pure site effect, climate explained 7.8%, soil explained 7.4%, and climate and soil variables together accounted for 11%, leaving 18% of the inter-site variation due to factors other than climate or soil. The results do not support the hypothesis that soil fertility is the "missing link" to explain leaf trait variation unexplained by climatic factors. Climate- and soil-induced leaf adaptations occur mostly among species, and leaf traits vary little within species in Chinese grassland plants, despite strongly varying climate and soil conditions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The soils of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau store a large amount of organic carbon, but the magnitude, spatial patterns and environmental controls of the storage are little investigated. In this study, using data of soil organic carbon (SOC) in 405 profiles collected from 135 sites across the plateau and a satellite-based dataset of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) during 2001-2004, we estimated storage and spatial patterns of SOC in the alpine grasslands. We also explored the relationships between SOC density (soil carbon storage per area) and climatic variables and soil texture. Our results indicated that SOC storage in the top 1 m in the alpine grasslands was estimated at 7.4 Pg C (1 Pg=1015 g), with an average density of 6.5 kg m-2. The density of SOC decreased from the southeastern to the northwestern areas, corresponding to the precipitation gradient. The SOC density increased significantly with soil moisture, clay and silt content, but weakly with mean annual temperature. These variables could together explain about 72% of total variation in SOC density, of which 54% was attributed to soil moisture, suggesting a key role of soil moisture in shaping spatial patterns of SOC density in the alpine grasslands.},

@article{Xie:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract The estimation of the size and changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is of great importance for decision makers to adopt proper measures to protect soils and to develop strategies for mitigation of greenhouse gases. In this paper, soil data from the Second State Soil Survey of China (SSSSC) conducted in the early 1980s and data published in the last 5 years were used to estimate the size of SOC stocks over the whole profile and their changes in China in last 20 years. Soils were identified as paddy, upland, forest, grassland or waste-land soils and an improved soil bulk density estimation method was used to estimate missing bulk density data. In the early 1980s, total SOC stocks were estimated at 89.61 Pg (1 Pg=103 Tg=1015 g) in China's 870.94 Mha terrestrial areas covered by 2473 soil series. In the paddy, upland, forest and grassland soils the respective total SOC stocks were 2.91 Pg on 29.87 Mha, 10.07 Pg on 125.89 Mha, 34.23 Pg on 249.32 Mha and 37.71 Pg on 278.51 Mha, respectively. The SOC density of the surface layer ranged from 3.5 Mg ha-1 in Gray Desery grassland soils to 252.6 Mg ha-1 in Mountain Meadow forest soils. The average area-weighted total SOC density in paddy soils (97.6 Mg ha-1) was higher than that in upland soils (80 Mg ha-1). Soils under forest (137.3 Mg ha-1) had a similar average area-weighted total SOC density as those under grassland (135.4 Mg ha-1). The annual estimated SOC accumulation rates in farmland and forest soils in the last 20 years were 23.61 and 11.72 Tg, respectively, leading to increases of 0.472 and 0.234 Pg SOC in farmland and forest areas, respectively. In contrast, SOC under grassland declined by 3.56 Pg due to the grassland degradation over this period. The resulting estimated net SOC loss in China's soils over the last 20 years was 2.86 Pg. The documented SOC accumulation in farmland and forest soils could thus not compensate for the loss of SOC in grassland soils in the last 20 years. There were, however, large regional differences: Soils in China's South and Eastern parts acted mainly as C sinks, increasing their average topsoil SOC by 132 and 145 Tg, respectively. In contrast, in the Northwest, Northeast, Inner Mongolia and Tibet significant losses of 1.38, 0.21, 0.49 and 1.01 Pg of SOC, respectively, were estimated over the last 20 years. These results highlight the importance to take measures to protect grassland and to improve management practices to increase C sequestration in farmland and forest soils.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Elevational patterns of species richness and their underlying mechanisms have long been a controversial issue in biodiversity and biogeographical research, and several hypotheses have been proposed in the past decades. Local and regional studies have suggested that area and geometric constraint are two of major factors affecting the elevational pattern of species richness. In this study, using data of seed plants and their distribution ranges and a Digital Elevation Model data set, we explored altitudinal patterns of seed plant richness and quantified the effects of area and the mid-domain effect (MDE) on the richness patterns in a high mountain area, Gaoligong Mountains (ranging from 215 m to 5791 m a.s.l.) located in south-eastern Tibet, China. The results showed that richness and density (richness/log-transformed area) of seed plants at species, genus, and family levels all showed hump-shaped patterns along the altitudinal gradient. The altitudinal changes in richness of species with three different range sizes (< 500 m, 500-1500 m, and > 1500 m), species of different plant life-forms (trees, shrubs, and herbs), and endemic species further confirmed this finding. Analysis of Generalized Linear Model depicted that although the area of each elevational band was always in high correlation with the species richness, the MDE could explain 84.9%, 33.8%, 83.8%, and 84.5% of the total variation in richness for all species and the three species groups with different range sizes, respectively. This suggests that the MDE significantly influences the patterns of species richness and is likely be stronger for broad-ranged species than for narrow-ranged ones in the Gaoligong Mountains.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the storage and spatial distribution of soil nitrogen (N) in China based on a data set of 2480 soil profiles and a map of Chinese soil types at a spatial resolution of 1:1,000,000. Our estimate indicates that the total N storage in China is 8.29x10(15) g, representing 5.9-8.7% of the total global N storage. The total N storage in China is on average or slightly above the average of its share in the global N storage, even though low nitrogen content soils cover a large area in China. N density varies substantially with soil types and regions. Peat soils in the southeast of Tibet, southwest China, show the highest averaged N density with a value of 7314.9 g/m(3) among all soil types. This is more than 30 times of the lowest N density of brown desert soils in the western desert and arid region. The highest N storages among all the soil types are the felty soil in southeast of Tibet, dark-brown earths in northeast China, and red earths in southeast China with values of 921.1, 611.4, and 569.6 Tg, respectively. N density also varies with land cover types in China. Wetlands in southwest China exhibit the highest N density at 6775.9 g/m(3) and deserts in northwest China have the least at 447.5 g/m(3). Our analysis also indicates that land cover types are poor predictors of N content. Further research is needed to examine how transformation from organic agriculture to increased use of fertilizers and pesticides has influenced N storage in China.},

	Abstract = {In arid and semi-arid grassland, many models hypothesize that desertification leads to the replacement of grassland by shrubland vegetation; however, the theoretical interpretations are open to debate. Therefore, a field study was conducted in the Guinan desertified grassland of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, North-west China, to test the hypotheses on a regional scale. We used four field sites to represent the four stages of desert development: slight, moderate, severe and very severe. A total of 40 quadrates were investigated in each site. Plant coverage, aboveground biomass, species richness and life-form were recorded: species diversity was calculated using the Simpson index and soil parameters were also measured. Our results indicate that the proportion of silt decreases from 12% in the slight stage to 1% in the very severe stage, clay from 71 % to 42% and sand from 17% to 93%. Soil water-holding capacity clearly decreases from the slight to the very severe stage. Soil organic matter (OM) is also reduced with desert development, which leads to destruction of the stability of soil physical structure and nutrient content, such as progressive N, P and K loss in surface and subsoil layers. In response to changes in soil properties, vegetation altered as regards species composition, species diversity, coverage, structure and life-form. Consequently, with desert development, herbaceous species, especially grasses, were lost from the community composition and replaced by xerophytic shrubs or semi-shrubs. Finally, psammophytic annual plants-dominated vegetation composition, while shrub maintained a low coverage. Although our results partially support previous hypotheses at the regional scale, it is considered that, apart from soil texture, soil OM and nutrients are the main factors mediating the dominance balance between shrub and herbaceous species.

	Abstract = {Climate change and human activities affect ecosystems simultaneously. To distinguish their respective roles, we analyzed the relative impacts of climate change and human activities on alpine grasslands in Northern Tibet, which are the source area of Asian major rivers. The changes and their causes were determined using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climatic and socio-economic factors at different intensities of human activity within sampling plots (including depopulated land without human influences) from 1981 to 2006. ManneKendall test (MK) was used to test the trend of NDVI change and Pearson correlation analyses was utilized in multiple regressions between NDVI and the influencing factors. Abrupt changes of NDVI occurred at different times in plots that differed in human activity. Regional climate change has produced more negative than positive changes on alpine grasslands. The alpine grasslands significantly benefited under a moderate intensity of grazing activities. With the increased human activity, negative changes in NDVI were pervasive in Northern Tibet.},

	Abstract = {Microbes play key roles in various biogeochemical processes, including carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. However, changes of microbial community at the functional gene level by livestock grazing, which is a global land-use activity, remain unclear. Here we use a functional gene array, GeoChip 4.0, to examine the effects of free livestock grazing on the microbial community at an experimental site of Tibet, a region known to be very sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation and global warming. Our results showed that grazing changed microbial community functional structure, in addition to aboveground vegetation and soil geochemical properties. Further statistical tests showed that microbial community functional structures were closely correlated with environmental variables, and variations in microbial community functional structures were mainly controlled by aboveground vegetation, soil C/N ratio, and NH4 (+) -N. In-depth examination of N cycling genes showed that abundances of N mineralization and nitrification genes were increased at grazed sites, but denitrification and N-reduction genes were decreased, suggesting that functional potentials of relevant bioprocesses were changed. Meanwhile, abundances of genes involved in methane cycling, C fixation, and degradation were decreased, which might be caused by vegetation removal and hence decrease in litter accumulation at grazed sites. In contrast, abundances of virulence, stress, and antibiotics resistance genes were increased because of the presence of livestock. In conclusion, these results indicated that soil microbial community functional structure was very sensitive to the impact of livestock grazing and revealed microbial functional potentials in regulating soil N and C cycling, supporting the necessity to include microbial components in evaluating the consequence of land-use and/or climate changes.},

	Abstract = {The meadow ecosystem on the Qing- hai-Tibetan Plateau is considered to be sensitive to climate change. An understanding of the alpine meadow ecosystem is therefore important for pre- dicting the response of ecosystems to climate change. In this study, we use the coefficients of variation (Cv) and stability (E) obtained from the Haibei Alpine Meadow Ecosystem Research Station to characterize the ecosystem stability. The results suggest that the net primary production of the alpine meadow eco- system was more stable (Cv = 13.18%) than annual precipitation (Cv = 16.55%) and annual mean air temperature (Cv = 28.82%). The net primary produc- tion was insensitive to either the precipitation (E = 0.0782) or air temperature (E = 0.1113). In summary, the alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai- Tibetan Plateau is much stable. Comparison of alpine meadow ecosystem stability with other five natural grassland ecosystems in Israel and southern African indicates that the alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is the most stable ecosystem. The alpine meadow ecosystem with relatively simple structure has high stability, which indicates that community stability is not only correlated with biodi- versity and community complicity but also with envi- ronmental stability. An average oscillation cycles of 3―4 years existed in annual precipitation, annual mean air temperature, net primary production and the population size of consumers at the Haibei natural ecosystem. The high stability of the alpine meadow ecosystem may be resulting also from the adaptation of the ecosystem to the alpine environment.},

	Abstract = {Rangelands of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP), although sparsely populated and contributing little to China's overall economy, play an important environmental role throughout Asia. They contain high biodiversity values and can also potentially provide China with a source of cultural and geographic variety in the future. Chinese government reports paint a gloomy picture, considering vast portions of the QTP degraded and blaming irrational overstocking of livestock as the principal culprit. Global climate change, population increases, and ``rodent'' damage are also invoked as causes of rangeland degradation. In contrast, some Western observers claim that traditional pastoral practices were sustainable, and identify either previous or more recent state policies as the cause of degradation. Chinese governments at national and provincial levels have initiated a number of sometimes-conflicting and confusing policies aimed, at least nominally, at restoring rangeland productivity. On the basis of a comprehensive literature review, I argue that the extent and magnitude of rangeland degradation on the QTP remains largely unknown because monitoring programs have been subjective and poorly documented. Further, I argue that causes of degradation remain uncertain, often because hypotheses have been articulated too vaguely to test. No phenomena that have been hypothesized as contributing to rangeland degradation on the QTP currently enjoy unequivocal support. Where over-stocking is clearly causing damage, we lack sufficient understanding of current socio-ecological systems to identify ultimate and proximate drivers of pastoralist behavior, and thus policy initiatives aimed at sustainability may well fail.},

@article{Zhang:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Land use change and management practices have greatly affected global carbon dynamics, especially the critical process of ecosystem respiration (Re). Our aim was to assess how Re and Re intensity (Re per unit aboveground biomass) are affected by land use (i.e. native alpine meadow with winter grazing (NAM), abandoned cropland/pastureland (APL), perennial Elymus nutans (PEN) and annual Avena sativa L pasture (AO)) and management practices (i.e. nitrogen (N) inorganic fertilizer or sheep manure for APL PEN and AO, tillage and no-tillage for AO) in a Gelic Cambisol soil underlying alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau from 2008 to 2010. In the present study we hypothesized that (1) the conversion of abandoned cropland/pastureland to pasturelands would increase Re and Re intensity; (2) natural restoration following the abandonment of cropland/pastureland would decrease Re and Re intensity; and (3) management practices mentioned above would reduce the magnitude of the effects of land use change on Re and Re intensity in the alpine meadow ecosystem. Generally, our results did not support our hypotheses. There were no significant differences between annual average Re in NAM and APL, while the annual average Re for native meadows were 2-3 times higher than that of pasturelands in 2008. Re intensities for PEN and AO were 1.7 times lower than NAM and APL, and Re intensity was higher for APL than for NAM in 2010. Management practices did not significantly affect Re and Re intensity for PEN and AO treatments, except for the interaction between tillage and year on the Re of AO in 2010. The results suggest that conversion of abandoned cropland/pastureland to pastureland decreases Re and Re intensity, while natural restoration following the abandonment of cropland/pastureland increased Re intensity. Management practices did not significantly modify the patterns of the effects of land use on Re and Re intensity. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Uncertainty about the effects of warming and grazing on soil nitrogen (N) availability, species composition, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) limits our ability to predict how global carbon sequestration will vary under future warming with grazing in alpine regions. Through a controlled asymmetrical warming (1.2/1.7 degrees C during daytime/nighttime) with a grazing experiment from 2006 to 2010 in an alpine meadow, we found that warming alone and moderate grazing did not significantly affect soil net N mineralization. Although plant species richness significantly decreased by 10% due to warming after 2008, we caution that this may be due to the transient occurrence or disappearance of some rare plant species in all treatments. Warming significantly increased graminoid cover, except in 2009, and legume cover after 2008, but reduced non-legume forb cover in the community. Grazing significantly decreased cover of graminoids and legumes before 2009 but increased forb cover in 2010. Warming significantly increased ANPP regardless of grazing, whereas grazing reduced the response of ANPP to warming. N addition did not affect ANPP in both warming and grazing treatments. Our findings suggest that soil N availability does not determine ANPP under simulated warming and that heavy grazing rather than warming causes degradation of the alpine meadows.},

Very little is known about how such responses depend on the availability of N in different chemical forms. Here we hypothesize that idiosyncratic year-to-year responses of plant functional groups to availability and form of nitrogen explain species coexistence in an alpine meadow community after release from grazing. We conducted a 6year N addition experiment in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau released from grazing by livestock. The experimental design featured three N forms (ammonium, nitrate, and ammonium nitrate), crossed with three levels of N supply rates (0.375, 1.500 and 7.500gNm-2yr-1), with unfertilized treatments without and with light grazing as controls. All treatments showed increasing productivity and decreasing species richness after cessation of grazing and these responses were stronger at higher N rates. Although N forms did not affect aboveground biomass at community level, different functional groups did show different responses to N chemical form and supply rate and these responses varied from year to year. In support of our hypothesis, these idiosyncratic responses seemed to enable a substantial diversity and biomass of sedges, forbs, and legumes to still coexist with the increasingly productive grasses in the absence of grazing, at least at low and intermediate N availability regimes. This study provides direct field-based evidence in support of the hypothesis that idiosyncratic and annually varying responses to both N quantity and quality may be a key driver of community structure and species coexistence. This finding has important implications for the diversity and functioning of other ecosystems with spatial and temporal variation in available N quantity and quality as related to changing atmospheric N deposition, land-use, and climate-induced soil warming.},

	Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and carbon--nitrogen (C:N) ratio are key foliar traits with great ecological importance, but their patterns across biomes have only recently been explored. We conducted a systematic census of foliar C, N and C:N ratio for 213 species, from 41 families over 199 research sites across the grassland biomes of China following the same protocol, to explore how diVerent environmental conditions and species composition aVect leaf N and C:N stoichiometry. Leaf C:N stoichiometry is stable in three distinct climatic regions in Inner Mongolia, the Tibetan Plateau, and Xinjiang Autonomous Region, despite considerable variations among co-existing species and among diVerent vegetation types. Our results also show that life form and genus identity explain more than 70% of total variations of foliar N and C:N ratio, while mean growing season temperature and growing season precipitation explained only less than 3%. This suggests that, at the biome scale, temperature aVects leaf N mainly through a change in plant species composition rather than via temperature itself. When our data were pooled with a global dataset, the previously observed positive correlation between leaf N and mean annual temperature (MAT) at very low MATs, disappeared. Thus, our data do not support the previously proposed biogeochemical hypothesis that low temperature limitations on mineralization of organic matter and N availability in soils lead to low leaf N in cold environments.},

	Abstract = {Global climate change is predicted to have large impacts on the phenology and reproduction of alpine plants, which will have important implications for plant demography and community interactions, trophic dynamics, ecosystem energy balance, and human livelihoods. In this article we report results of a 3-year, fully factorial experimental study exploring how warming, snow addition, and their combination affect reproductive phenology, effort, and success of four alpine plant species belonging to three different life forms in a semiarid, alpine meadow ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that warming and snow addition change reproductive phenology and success, but responses are not uniform across species. Moreover, traits associated with resource acquisition, such as rooting depth and life history (early vs. late flowering), mediate plant phenology, and reproductive responses to changing climatic conditions. Specifically, we found that warming delayed the reproductive phenology and decreased number of inflorescences of Kobresia pygmaea C. B. Clarke, a shallow-rooted, early-flowering plant, which may be mainly constrained by upper-soil moisture availability. Because K. pygmaea is the dominant species in the alpine meadow ecosystem, these results may have important implications for ecosystem dynamics and for pastoralists and wildlife in the region.},
