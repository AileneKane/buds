Notes on budburst experiment (Jan-April or so? 2015)


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Stan work: to get to full model
	- doymod1: DOY model with complete pooling (no site or species or individual)
	- fake data to check doymod1, predictive checks?
	- doymod2: DOY model with site (no species or individual)
	- doymod3: DOY model with site and species (no individual)
	- doymod4: DOY model with site, species, individual
	- fake data to check doymod4, predictive checks?
Next!
	- repeat above with ordinal data and do fake data at each stage

%%% Get freezing risk -- USDA hardiness depends on average annual minimum temperature. Better metrics also include snow cover (low snow cover = less insulation). St. Hipp is zone 4a (-30 -25°F, agr.gc.ca; planthardiness.gc.ca).
% McKenney 2014 BioSci: update of Canadian hardiness zone maps, show shifts in 62 tree spcies sinzce 1960 map. Greatest change in Western Canada, but increase in easte of ~1 zone. Based on multiple climate variables, not just USDA average annual minimum temp, which shows smaller change.

% Raulier and Bernier 2000: Acer saccharaum leafout as a phenology model. Model uses days above 10*C asfor warming, days below 10°C for chilling.
% False spring index: julian date of last hard frost (mimum daily temp below -2.2) minus date of leaf emergence.

Larcher 2005: cutoff for mild winters ~ -20C,  above this considered cold winter. St. Hipp definitely in cold winter

Hufaker 2012: Sugar maple opportunistic, yellow birch and beech conservative.

Vitasse 2014 J Ecol
Earlier leaf-out rather than difference in freezing resistance puts juvenile trees at greater risk of damage than adult trees. 
Not just young trees dont' differ in freezing resistance, just in timing of when they break bud

Richardson 2006 - 
Of Ace sac, Fag bra, and Bet all, maple the first to leaf out; beech last to drop leaves. Onset of spring delayed 2.7 d per 100 m elevation. Accumulated degree days predicts spring canopy development well. 

Argue that chilling requirements are not that important, usually met easily. 

Hannifin 1995 Need to do experiments to separate out effects of chilling, photoperiod, and heating.

Ibanez et al. 2010 - forsythia, ginkgo, mulberry: All 207 days earlier per degree C between 1953-2005. 

Polger & Primack Arnold: Earliest leaf out shrubs: introduced lilac, honeysuckle, bayberry, apple. Natives: spiraea, pop tre,pro see, bet pop.
Last to leaf out: Fra ame, nays syl, poison sumac and buttonbush last of all. 
Species specific cues because of tradeoff. Stem anatomy: larger vessel elements for later species. 
Photoperiod req: Fra ame, oaks, hackberry (celtic occidentalis)
Claim without cites that opportunistic species are early successional and have no photoperiod requriemtn: birch, corals, poplar. 

Hunter and Lechowicz 1992 number of chilling units for leaflet depends on both species and weather of preceding growing season
