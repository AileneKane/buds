Notes on budburst experiment (Jan-April or so? 2015)


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Stan work: to get to full model
	- doymod1: DOY model with complete pooling (no site or species or individual)
	- fake data to check doymod1, predictive checks?
	- doymod2: DOY model with site (no species or individual)
	- doymod3: DOY model with site and species (no individual)
	- doymod4: DOY model with site, species, individual
	- fake data to check doymod4, predictive checks?
Next!
	- repeat above with ordinal data and do fake data at each stage

%%% Get freezing risk -- USDA hardiness depends on average annual minimum temperature. Better metrics also include snow cover (low snow cover = less insulation). St. Hipp is zone 4a (-30 -25°F, agr.gc.ca; planthardiness.gc.ca).
% McKenney 2014 BioSci: update of Canadian hardiness zone maps, show shifts in 62 tree spcies sinzce 1960 map. Greatest change in Western Canada, but increase in easte of ~1 zone. Based on multiple climate variables, not just USDA average annual minimum temp, which shows smaller change.

% Raulier and Bernier 2000: Acer saccharaum leafout as a phenology model. Model uses days above 10*C asfor warming, days below 10°C for chilling.
% False spring index: julian date of last hard frost (mimum daily temp below -2.2) minus date of leaf emergence.
