Stan work: to get to full model
	- doymod1: DOY model with complete pooling (no site or species or individual)
	- fake data to check doymod1, predictive checks?
	- doymod2: DOY model with site (no species or individual)
	- doymod3: DOY model with site and species (no individual)
	- doymod4: DOY model with site, species, individual
	- fake data to check doymod4, predictive checks?
Next!
	- repeat above with ordinal data and do fake data at each stage
