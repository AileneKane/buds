**
To do tasks from 24 Sept and 1 Oct meetings
- Looking into literature on chilling (EMW) —> See new file litnotes_chilling
- Ask Tim to see what minimum temps were across all chambers during experiment, especially the Conviron one(s?) that did the 1.5 C chilling —> consider whether there could have been freezing at all?
- look into statistical options with individuals that do not leaf out (survival, ordinal regression etc.) — make a list
- how many studies in our lit review database did multiple levels of chilling (and what did they find?
- chambers for winter experiments?
**


Figure to do
 - Chilling treatments color-coded onto temp and photo period sensitivity figure

mean leaf out date - from the experiment

put on github

Data to do
- Nectar database for leafout categories, early/mid/late

- non-leafouts (“75s”): 0 or 1 for non leafout twigs across treatments, by species.


Writing to do
-  outline on git 

- beef up results, 

- methods

- linear analyses, posted to git.

- ‘discussion’

 -first go through analyses 

species level and individuals levels 

 - build fake data for stan? Think about how to move this forward
doy leaf burst

build up to ordered logit

# For 2015-09-17:
# Make fake data 

m1: simple

m2: add site

m3: add species

m4: add individual

Notes 2015-09-17

- boxplots for leafout day by species/site/treatment
- boxplots for leafout day including chilling treatment
- do the non-leafout species distributons
- If time: use O’Keefe data in PMP (windoze), maybe ask Tim’s help
