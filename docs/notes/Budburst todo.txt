# Todo update Feb 2016

Additional analyses
1. Phylogeny
2. Traits (wood anatomy)
3. By date of budburst

##
Moved to teamwork
Do the individual models for leafout day and nonleafouts
Do warm x photo for all species, chill0

Chilling experiments: photo * temp * chill + site 

Questions: were all species from genetic analysis in the chilling
Individual is nested w/in site. So should be adding individual as random effect, nested in individual. Should site still be a fixed effect? 
lday ~ site + warm + photo + species 

Tissue experiment: what species were included, in chilling

Species traits: leafout day in warm/long as their ‘natural’ leafout day for purposes of arranging them by early-late.



## Oct 15
Nonleafout column in the data processing -> done
Nonleafout models for each sp separately; put together summary. photo x chill x temp x site full model
Also for leafout day (should be same story as nl!) 
Wood anatomy data column for species: Ring-porous vs diffuse -> insidewood.lib.ncsu.edu
Risk: at site level, risk of spring freezing. At species level, investment in risk-management in wood anatomy

Leafout day for Fagus for Isabelle

- Physiological pathway for chilling (glucogen, microtubles)

**
To do tasks from 24 Sept and 1 Oct meetings
- Looking into literature on chilling (EMW) —> See new file litnotes_chilling
- Ask Tim to see what minimum temps were across all chambers during experiment, especially the Conviron one(s?) that did the 1.5 C chilling —> consider whether there could have been freezing at all? -> DF asked Tim to prep this
- look into statistical options with individuals that do not leaf out (survival, ordinal regression etc.) — make a list
- how many studies in our lit review database did multiple levels of chilling (and what did they find?
- chambers for winter experiments? —> DF asked Faye

**


Figure to do
 - Chilling treatments color-coded onto temp and photo period sensitivity figure

mean leaf out date - from the experiment

Data to do
- Nectar database for leafout categories, early/mid/late
- non-leafouts (“75s”): 0 or 1 for non leafout twigs across treatments, by species.


Writing to do
-  outline on git 

- beef up results, 
- methods
- linear analyses, posted to git.
- ‘discussion’
-first go through analyses 

species level and individuals levels 

 - build fake data for stan? Think about how to move this forward
doy leaf burst

build up to ordered logit

# For 2015-09-17:
# Make fake data 

m1: simple

m2: add site

m3: add species

m4: add individual

Notes 2015-09-17

- boxplots for leafout day by species/site/treatment
- boxplots for leafout day including chilling treatment
- do the non-leafout species distributons
- If time: use O’Keefe data in PMP (windoze), maybe ask Tim’s help
